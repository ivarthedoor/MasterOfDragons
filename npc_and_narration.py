    walls and roof are full of holes, aeverything is covered in moss. You feel the smell of water and rot.\n \
    You make few steps inside and right after you enter the room, something hits you from the back!",

    You use other leg to kick goblin in the back!\n \
    Right after hit, he drops your leg and falls.\n \
    In one quick swing of your sword you kill the beast.",

    You find yourself among the ruins of a structure that appears to have been built by an extinct civilization.\n \
    The sky is completely black, with no stars in sight, and everything is illuminated by something resembling a violet sun.\n \
    Here and there, clusters of gray-green grass grow.",
            4: "Suddenly, from behind one of the 'buildings,' or what's left of it, you hear a noise approaching.\n \
    You hide behind a pillar, and peeking out of the corner of your eye,\n \
    you see a group of goblins with torches moving through the ruins,\n \
    led by one much larger goblin clad in armor â€” clearly their leader.",
            5: "You wait in hiding until the enemies pass you by.\n \
    As soon as they move a safe distance away, you step out from behind the pillar.\n \
    Looking around, you realize you are surrounded by goblins. You must tread very carefully.",
            6: "Silently, you sneak through the deserted streets, occasionally avoiding encounters with more goblins,\n \
    until you reach an old bridge guarded on both sides by towers.\n \
    As you approach, you notice that the bridge is protected by stone doors,\n \
    and at their center is a seal glowing red with some kind of inscription on it.",

            9: "A translucent, bright white figure of an elf emerged from the wall.",
            10: "You approach the seal and read the riddle:",
            11: "The stone doors open with a heavy scraping sound. You step onto the bridge, and Dundalion follows behind you.",
